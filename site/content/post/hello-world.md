ClichÃ©d, I know. But it had to be done. As the first post on this site some formalities have to be satisfied, and as a programmer it would be remiss of me not to label them properly.

### Down to Business ###

With that out of the way: Iâ€™m building this site primarily as an opportunity to educate myself about web design practices. This idea stemmed from my interest in the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.wtf/) concept and the beautiful simplicity of it all. I had been meaning to work on a personal site or blog of some sort, and I figured this would be the perfect approach for the time being.

I may explore the details of the JAMstack in a later post, but itâ€™s essentially an evolution of the static web page. By synthesizing the power of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (Markdown in this case), JAMstack websites can provide semi-dynamic content while boasting the lightweight benefits of static sites. This also makes them entirely server-less, allowing for accessible deployment and hosting via platforms such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Iâ€™d like to continue updating this site as I learn more about web design paradigms and discover new ways to leverage the JAMstack. Meanwhile, I plan on occasionally adding a post or two as a form of thought-bank. Maybe Iâ€™ll come back in a couple of years to reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned since (hopefully enough to feel a little proud ðŸ˜‰).
