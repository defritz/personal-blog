Although I now call Portland home, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I received my Bachelor of Science
in Computer Science from Texas Tech University in 2019, graduating Summa Cum Laude with Honors.

Currently, I work as a Full Stack Software Engineer at [Tavour](https://www.tavour.com/), helping to connect independent breweries with
craft beer lovers all over the country.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, exploring the nature of the PNW, and working on cool projects like this webpage.

Continually building out my skillset is the driving factor behind my work, and
I'm always looking for new ways to become a better developer.
